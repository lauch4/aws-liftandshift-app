## Architect and deploy tomcat application and dependencies on AWS EC2 instances

### Based on [vprofile project from ](https://github.com/devopshydclub/vprofile-project/tree/aws-LiftAndShift) from ongoig DevOps course on Udemy.

I improved the scripts and made some from scratch since some of them are outdated and services won't install on EC2 instances.

Will be updating and documenting.
